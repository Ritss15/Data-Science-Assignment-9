# Week 9 – House Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Project Overview
This project builds a simple machine learning model to predict house prices
using Linear Regression.

## Dataset
- house_prices.csv (300 records)

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Visualization of Actual vs Predicted prices

## Key Result
The model shows good performance with predictions closely matching actual prices.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset
3. Run all cells
